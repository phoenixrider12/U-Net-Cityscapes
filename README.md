# U-Net-Cityscapes

### Vanilla U-Net implementation for multiclass semantic segmentation on Cityscapes dataset 

Here we have built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based U-Net architecture model to perform semantic segmentation task to segment out various obejcts present in the real world street scene images of [Cityscapes](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/cityscapes-image-pairs) dataset. The results are shown in the image below:
